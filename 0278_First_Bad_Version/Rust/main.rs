// You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
// Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
// You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// isBadVersion(version:i32)-> bool;
// to call it use self.isBadVersion(version)

impl Solution {
    pub fn first_bad_version(&self, n: i32) -> i32 {
        // Busqueda binaria dado que el array esta ordenado
        let mut left = 1;
        let mut right = n;
        while left < right {
            let mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if self.isBadVersion(mid) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
